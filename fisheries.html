Oil destroys the insulating ability of fur-bearing mammals, such as sea otters, and the water-repelling ability of feathered birds, exposing them to the harsh elements. There can be multiple reasons for this, people making mistakes or being careless, equipment breaking down ,natural disasters such as hurricanes, storm surge or high winds Oil usually spreads out rapidly across the waterâ€™s surface to form a thin oil slick. As the oil continues spreading, the slick becomes thinner and thinner, finally becoming a very thin sheen, which often looks like a rainbow. (In rare cases, very heavy oil can sometimes sink.) Many birds and animals also swallow oil and are poisoned when they try to clean themselves or when eating oiled prey.</p></div>

There is satellite telemetry, which uses tags attached to the outside of an animal that transmit their position to satellites. This method can track highly migratory species but can only get a location when an animal surfaces. The other option is acoustic telemetry, which uses implanted tags and can track an animal that stays underwater. Solution is required which can tell details about the presence of fish in the region</p></div>
